    Current value (from the default) = "atom"
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:109

    This configuration is used to select a default profile in Chrome OS based on
    the microarchitectures we are using. This is only used if
    clang_use_default_sample_profile is true and clang_sample_profile_path is
    empty.

chromeos_is_browser_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:19

    Deprecated, use is_lacros.
   
    This controls UI configuration for Chrome.
    If this flag is set, we assume Chrome runs on Chrome OS devices, using
    Wayland (instead of X11).
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1052397):
    Define chromeos_product instead, which takes either "browser" or "ash".
    Re-define the following variables as:
    is_lacros = chromeos_product == "browser"
    is_ash = chromeos_product == "ash"

clang_base_path

compute_build_timestamp
    Current value (from the default) = "compute_build_timestamp.py"
      From //build/timestamp.gni:17

    This should be the filename of a script that prints a single line
    containing an integer that's a unix timestamp in UTC.
    This timestamp is used as build time and will be compiled into
    other code.
   
    This argument may look unused. Before removing please check with the
    chromecast team to see if they still use it internally.

compute_inputs_for_analyze
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compute_inputs_for_analyze.gni:13

    Enable this flag when running "gn analyze".
   
    This causes some gn actions to compute inputs immediately (via exec_script)
    where they would normally compute them only when executed (and write them to
    a depfile).
   
    This flag will slow down GN, but is required for analyze to work properly.

concurrent_links
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/concurrent_links.gni:23

    Limit the number of concurrent links; we often want to run fewer
    links at once than we do compiles, because linking is memory-intensive.
    The default to use varies by platform and by the amount of memory
    available, so we call out to a script to get the right value.

      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:36

    The path to the coverage instrumentation input file should be a source root
    absolute path (e.g. //out/Release/coverage_instrumentation_input.txt), and
    the file consists of multiple lines where each line represents a path to a
    source file, and the paths must be relative to the root build directory.
    e.g. ../../base/task/post_task.cc for build directory 'out/Release'.
   
    NOTE that this arg will be non-op if use_clang_coverage is false.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromeos/ash/components/assistant/assistant.gni:18

    Enable Assistant integration tests using LibAssistant and a fake S3 server.
    This requires libassistant.so to support grpc communication with the S3
    server, which increases the library size, which is why we introduced this
    flag to disable them in the release builds.

enable_audio_capture_service
    Current value (from the default) = false

enable_downstream_media_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/test/media_router/BUILD.gn:10

    Many of the targets defined in this file have dependencies that cannot be
    satisfied without additional downstream resources. Explicitly guard them
    them behind this flag so that we do not attempt to build or isolate targets
    in public chromium checkouts.

enable_dsyms
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/apple/symbols.gni:17

    Produce dSYM files for targets that are configured to do so. dSYM
    generation is controlled globally as it is a linker output (produced via
    the //build/toolchain/apple/linker_driver.py. Enabling this will result in
    all shared library, loadable module, and executable targets having a dSYM
    generated.

enable_expensive_dchecks
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:30

    Whether to include Feed in ChromeModern builds.

enable_ffmpeg_video_decoders
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:37
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:152

    On Android, FFMpeg is built without video decoders by default.
    This flag gives the option to override that decision in case there are no
    hardware decoders. To do so, you will also need to update ffmpeg build files
    in order to define which decoders to build in.

enable_full_stack_frames_for_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:67

    Compile in such a way as to make it possible for the profiler to unwind full
    stack frames. Setting this flag has a large effect on the performance of the
    generated code than just setting profiling, but gives the profiler more
    information to analyze.
    Requires profiling to be set to true.

enable_google_benchmarks
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/google_benchmark/buildconfig.gni:11

    Google Benchmark is not checked out by default, because it is only used by
    a few specialized benchmarks that most developers do not interact with.

enable_gpu_client_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/command_buffer/client/BUILD.gn:13

    Enable GPU client logging without DCHECK being on.

enable_gpu_service_logging

    Hangout services is an extension that adds extra features to Hangouts.
    It is enableable separately to facilitate testing.

enable_hls_demuxer
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:31
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:80

      From //out/thorium/args.gn:30
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:66

    Enable HLS with SAMPLE-AES decryption.

enable_ink
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:32
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //pdf/features.gni:18

    Enable ink libraries provided by the ChromeOS media app dependency.
   
    This argument indicates whether the ink libraries provided by the ChromeOS
    media app dependency is enabled. It also determines whether the annotation
    feature is enabled for the PDF viewer.

enable_ipc_fuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //tools/ipc_fuzzer/ipc_fuzzer.gni:15

enable_ipc_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ipc/features.gni:7

    Enabling debug builds automatically sets enable_ipc_logging to true.

enable_iterator_debugging
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:14
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:41

    When set, enables libc++ debug mode with iterator debugging.
   
    Iterator debugging is generally useful for catching bugs. But it can
    introduce extra locking to check the state of an iterator against the state
    of the current object. For iterator- and thread-heavy code, this can
    significantly slow execution - two orders of magnitude slowdown has been
    seen (crbug.com/903553) and iterator debugging also slows builds by making
    generation of snapshot_blob.bin take ~40-60 s longer. Therefore this
    defaults to off.

enable_js_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/protobuf/proto_library.gni:145

    Allows subprojects to omit javascript dependencies (e.g.) closure_compiler
    and google-closure-library.

enable_js_type_check
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/closure_compiler/compile_js.gni:11

    Enable closure type-checking for Chrome's web technology-based UI. This
    enables the webui_closure_compile target which does a no-op without this
    flag enabled. Requires Java.

      From //third_party/blink/public/public_features.gni:9

    If true, adds support for JPEG XL image decoding.

enable_keystone_registration_framework
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/BUILD.gn:60

    Indicates whether keystone registration framework should be enabled (see
    action("keystone_registration_framework") below).  There are some tests
    where we'd like for it to be disabled. (https://crbug.com/909080)

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libgav1/options.gni:12

enable_library_cdms
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:159

    Enables the use of library CDMs that implements the interface defined at
    media/cdm/api/content_decryption_module.h. If true, the actually library CDM
    will be hosted in the mojo CDM service running in the CDM (utility) process.

enable_linux_installer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/installer/BUILD.gn:11

enable_location_source
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:52

    Indicates if the Location object contains the source code information
    (file, function, line). False means only the program counter (and currently
    file name) is saved.

enable_log_error_not_reached
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/logging.gni:12

enable_logging_override
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:71

    Enable logging override, e.g. enable DVLOGs through level 2 at build time.
    On Chromecast, these are logged as INFO.
    On Fuchsia, these are logged as VLOGs.

      From //chrome/services/file_util/public/features.gni:14

    Enables analysis of Office documents for malicious macros

enable_mdns
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:25

    Multicast DNS.

enable_media_drm_storage
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:44
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:77

    Enable browser managed persistent metadata storage for EME persistent
    session and persistent usage record session.

enable_media_foundation_widevine_cdm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:51

enable_media_overlay

      From //out/thorium/args.gn:45
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:134

    Set to true to enable media overlay for volume bar, etc.

enable_media_remoting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:254

    This switch defines whether the Media Remoting implementation will be built.
    When enabled, media is allowed to be renderer and played back on remote
    devices when the tab is being casted and other conditions are met.

enable_media_remoting_rpc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:260

    Media Remoting RPC is disabled on Android since it's unused but increases
    the native binary size by ~70Kb.

enable_message_center
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:30

enable_modular_updater
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:33

    Set true to enable modular_updater.

enable_mojo_tracing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/cpp/bindings/BUILD.gn:12

enable_mojom_closure_compile
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:44

    Enables Closure compilation of generated JS lite bindings. In environments
    where compilation is supported, any mojom target "foo" will also have a
    corresponding "foo_js_library_for_compile" target generated.

enable_mojom_fuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:51

    Enables generating javascript fuzzing-related code and the bindings for the
    MojoLPM fuzzer targets. Off by default.

enable_mojom_message_id_scrambling
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:39

    Controls message ID scrambling behavior. If |true|, message IDs are
    scrambled (i.e. randomized based on the contents of //chrome/VERSION) on
    non-Chrome OS desktop platforms. Set to |false| to disable message ID
    scrambling on all platforms.

enable_mojom_typemapping
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:33

    Indicates whether typemapping should be supported in this build
    configuration. This may be disabled when building external projects which
    depend on //mojo but which do not need/want all of the Chromium tree
    dependencies that come with typemapping.
   
    Note that (perhaps obviously) a huge amount of Chromium code will not build
    with typemapping disabled, so it is never valid to set this to |false| in
    any Chromium build configuration.

enable_mse_mpeg2ts_stream_parser
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:56
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:58

enable_mutex_priority_inheritance
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/BUILD.gn:68

    Set to true to enable mutex priority inheritance. See the comments in
    LockImpl::PriorityInheritanceAvailable() in lock_impl_posix.cc for the
    platform requirements to safely enable priority inheritance.

enable_offline_pages
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/offline_pages/buildflags/features.gni:8

    Whether to enable OfflinePages support. Currently user-visible features
    are Android-only.

enable_offline_pages_harness
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/offline_pages/buildflags/features.gni:12

    This enables test API for locally-built harness which is used for quality
    evaluations. Requires setting this variable manually at local environment.

enable_oop_printing
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:35

    Enables out-of-process printing. While this definition matches
    `enable_print_preview`, do not base this definition upon that.  This
    feature could still be appropriate for some build configurations which
    explicitly disable print preview.

enable_opengl_apitrace
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:35

    Enable explicit apitrace (https://apitrace.github.io) loading.
    This requires apitrace library with additional bindings.
    See ChromeOS package for details:
    https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/2659419
    Chrome will not start without an apitrace.so library.
    Trace will be saved to /tmp/gltrace.dat file by default. You can
    override it at run time with TRACE_FILE=<path> environment variable.

enable_openscreen
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/browser/media/router/features.gni:14

enable_openxr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:18

    To build with OpenXR support, the OpenXR Loader needs to be pulled to
    third_party/openxr.

enable_paint_preview
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/buildflags_paint_preview.gni:15

    Enable basic paint preview support. Does not work on iOS. Should
    not be included with Chromecast.
    Used by //components/paint_preview and //third_party/harfbuzz-ng.
    TODO(crbug.com/webrtc/11223) Move back this file in
    //components/paint_preview/ once WebRTC doesn't roll harfbuzz-ng anymore,
    for consistency sake.

enable_perfetto_traced_perf
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:166

enable_perfetto_traced_probes
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:257

    The traced_probes daemon is very Linux-specific, as it depends on ftrace and
    various /proc interfaces. There is no point making its code platform-neutral
    as it won't do anything useful on Windows.
    The only reason why we still build it on Mac OS is to be able to run the
    unittests there and making dev on mac less cumbersome. The traced_probes
    code happens to build cleanly and for now the mainteinance cost on Mac is
    extremely low.

enable_perfetto_tracing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:119

    Support using system perfetto tracing

enable_perfetto_ui

enable_platform_ac3_eac3_audio
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:53
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:49

    Enables AC3/EAC3 audio demuxing. This is enabled only on Chromecast, since
    it only provides demuxing, and is only useful for AC3/EAC3 audio
    pass-through to HDMI sink on Chromecast.

enable_platform_dolby_vision
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:54
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:63

    Enable Dolby Vision demuxing. Enable by default for Chromecast. Actual
    decoding must be provided by the platform. Note some Dolby Vision profiles
    which are encoded using HEVC require |enable_platform_hevc| to be enabled.

enable_platform_dts_audio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:55

    Enables DTS/DTSX audio handling in chromium. This includes demuxing,

enable_print_media_l10n
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/printing/BUILD.gn:15

    Enable print media localization only on the platforms that support CUPS IPP
    (ChromeOS and macOS for now). The localization expects media vendor IDs
    uniquely generated by CUPS IPP.

enable_print_preview
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:21

    Enables printing with print preview.
    Print preview requires PDF per //printing/BUILD.gn.
    The is_android condition is currently redundant but left for clarity.

enable_profiling
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:17
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:69

    Compile in such a way as to enable profiling of the generated code. For
    example, don't omit the frame pointer and leave in symbols.

enable_pseudolocales
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/locales.gni:243

    We want to give pseudolocales to everyone except end-users (devs & QA).
    Note that this only packages the locales in, and doesn't add the ui to enable them.

enable_qr_print
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/qr_code_generator/BUILD.gn:7

    Enables building a development / debugging binary.

enable_random_mojo_delays
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/cpp/bindings/BUILD.gn:18

    enable_random_mojo_delays starts a task runner that periodically pauses
    random Mojo bindings and later resumes them, in order to test whether parts
    of the code implicitly rely on FIFO processing of messages sent on different
    message pipes (which they should not).

enable_reading_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //components/reading_list/features/reading_list.gni:8

    Controls whether reading list support is active or not. Currently only
    supported on iOS (on other platforms, the feature is always disabled).

enable_remoting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //remoting/remoting_enable.gni:12

enable_remoting_for_cwr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:148

    True to use the remoting implementation of cast streaming for the cast web
    runtime (as opposed to the mirroring-only implementation).

enable_reporting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:28

    Reporting not used on iOS.

enable_resource_allowlist_generation
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:16
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/toolchain/gcc_toolchain.gni:28

enable_rust
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:17

    Whether to allow Rust code to be part of the Chromium *build process*.
    This can be used to create Rust test binaries, even if the flag below
    is false.

enable_screen_ai_service
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //components/services/screen_ai/buildflags/features.gni:11

enable_segment_heap
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/manifest.gni:46

enable_service_discovery
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:55

enable_session_service
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:59

    Enables use of the session service, which is enabled by default.
    Android stores them separately on the Java side.

enable_skia_dawn_gtests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //skia/features.gni:13

    Enable gtests using SkiaRenderer Dawn.
    TODO(rivr): Remove this and enable the tests by default once a software
    path for D3D12 is available.

enable_skia_wuffs_gif
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //skia/BUILD.gn:30

enable_soda
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/soda/buildflags.gni:7

    Used to enable the Speech On-Device API (SODA) in unit and browser tests.

enable_speech_service
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/services/speech/buildflags/buildflags.gni:12

    Whether the browser provides a speech recognition service
    (//media/mojo/mojom/speech_recognition_service.mojom) to the renderer.
    TODO(b:223493879): Add support for speech to LaCrOS via go/crosapi and
                       change `is_chromeos_ash` to `is_chromeos` below.

enable_stack_trace_line_numbers
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/logging.gni:13

enable_stripping
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:8
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/apple/symbols.gni:24

    Strip symbols from linked targets by default. If this is enabled, the
    //build/config/mac:strip_all config will be applied to all linked targets.
    If custom stripping parameters are required, remove that config from a
    linked target and apply custom -Wcrl,strip flags. See
    //build/toolchain/apple/linker_driver.py for more information.

enable_supervised_users
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:63

    Enables supervision for Family Link users.
    Supervision is only supported on Chrome OS and Android.

enable_swiftshader
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/gl/features.gni:30

enable_swiftshader_vulkan
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //gpu/vulkan/features.gni:17

    Enable swiftshader vulkan. Disabling it can save build time, however
    --use-vulkan=swiftshader and some tests which use swiftshader vulkan will
    not work.

enable_system_notifications
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:67

enable_tagged_pdf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:45

    Enables exporting to tagged PDF.

enable_trace_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/openscreen/src/util/BUILD.gn:11

    Enables trace logging in build. This is true by default, unless
    we are built against Chrome--we have no way to link their platform
    implementation into our binaries so trace logging is not possible.

enable_typescript_bindings
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:47

    Enables generating Typescript bindings and compiling them to JS bindings.

enable_video_capture_service
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:109

    Set to true to enable video capture service for video input and output.

enable_video_with_mixed_audio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:83

    Set to true to enable a CMA media backend that allows mixed audio to be
    output with sync'd video.

enable_vr
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:50
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:25

    Enable VR device support whenever VR device SDK(s) are supported.
    We enable VR on Linux even though VR features aren't usable because
    the binary size impact is small and allows many VR tests to run on Linux

enable_vulkan
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //gpu/vulkan/features.gni:12

enable_wayland_server
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:70

    Indicates if Wayland display server support is enabled.

enable_websockets
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:13

    WebSockets and socket stream code are not used on iOS and are optional in
    cronet.

enable_webui_tab_strip
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:21
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //ui/webui/webui_features.gni:14

    Enable the WebUI version of the browser's tab strip.

enable_widevine
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:42
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:15

    Enables Widevine key system support. Enabled by default in Google Chrome,
    on Android and Fuchsia platforms.
    Can be optionally enabled in Chromium on non-Android platforms. Please see
    //src/third_party/widevine/LICENSE file for details.

enable_wmax_tokens
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:154

enable_xz_extractor
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/services/file_util/public/features.gni:11

    Whether the file_util service supports .xz file extraction.
    Currently only used by imageWriterPrivate extension API, so only enabled
    when Extensions are enabled.

exclude_unwind_tables
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:12
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:120

    Exclude unwind tables by default for official builds as unwinding can be
    done from stack dumps produced by Crashpad at a later time "offline" in the
    crash server. Since this increases binary size, we don't recommend including
    them in shipping builds.
    For unofficial (e.g. development) builds and non-Chrome branded (e.g. Cronet
    which doesn't use Crashpad, crbug.com/479283) builds it's useful to be able
    to unwind at runtime.
    Include the unwind tables on Android even for official builds, as otherwise
    the crash dumps generated by Android's debuggerd are largely useless, and
    having this additional mechanism to understand issues is particularly helpful
    to WebView.

extended_tracing_enabled
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/trace_event/tracing.gni:11

    Enable more trace events. Disabled by default due to binary size impact,
    but highly recommended for local development.

fatal_linker_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:75

    Enable fatal linker warnings. Building Chromium with certain versions
    of binutils can cause linker warning.

ffmpeg_branding
    Current value = "Chrome"
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:36
    Overridden from the default = "Chromium"
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:44

    Controls whether we build the Chromium or Google Chrome version of FFmpeg.
    The Google Chrome version contains additional codecs. Typical values are
    Chromium, Chrome, and ChromeOS.

ffmpeg_use_unsafe_atomics
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:62

    Set to true to force the use of ffmpeg's stdatomic fallback code. This code
    is unsafe and does not implement atomics properly. https://crbug.com/161723.
   
    Windows and GCC prior to 4.9 lack stdatomic.h.
   
    This is also useful for developers who use icecc, which relies upon
    clang's -frewrite-includes flag which is broken with #include_next
    directives as used in chromium's clang stdatomic.h.
    Some background: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26828

forbid_non_component_debug_builds
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:107

    Whether an error should be raised on attempts to make debug builds with
    is_component_build=false. Very large debug symbols can have unwanted side
    effects so this is enforced by default for chromium.

force_cast_bluetooth
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/bluetooth/cast_bluetooth.gni:4

from_here_uses_location_builtins
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:55

    Whether or not the FROM_HERE macro uses base::Location::Current().

gcc_target_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:19

    When non empty, overrides the target rpath value. This allows a user to
    make a Chromium build where binaries and shared libraries are meant to be
    installed into separate directories, like /usr/bin/chromium and
    /usr/lib/chromium for instance. It is useful when a build system that
    generates a whole target root filesystem (like Yocto) is used on top of gn,
    especially when cross-compiling.
    Note: this gn arg is similar to gyp target_rpath generator flag.

generate_fuzzer_owners
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:166

    Generates an owners file for each fuzzer test.
    TODO(crbug.com/1194183): Remove this arg when finding OWNERS is faster.

generate_linker_map
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:21

    Used for binary size analysis.

gold_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:71

    When we are going to use gold we need to find it.
    This is initialized below, after use_gold might have been overridden.

goma_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:17

    Absolute directory containing the gomacc binary.

google_api_key
    Current value = "AIzaSyCkfPOPZXDKNn8hhgu3JrA62wIgC93d44k"
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:3
    Overridden from the default = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:48

    Set these to bake the specified API keys and OAuth client
    IDs/secrets into your build.
   
    If you create a build without values baked in, you can instead
    set environment variables to provide the keys at runtime (see
    src/google_apis/google_api_keys.h for details).  Features that
    require server-side APIs may fail to work if no keys are
    provided.
   
    Note that if you are building an official build or if
    use_official_google_api_keys has been set to trie (explicitly or
    implicitly), these values will be ignored and the official
    keys will be used instead.

google_default_client_id
    Current value = "811574891467.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:4
    Overridden from the default = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:51

    See google_api_key.

google_default_client_secret
    Current value = "kdloedMFGdGla2P1zacGjAQh"
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:5
    Overridden from the default = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:54

    See google_api_key.

gtest_enable_absl_printers
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:39

    Allows googletest to pretty-print various absl types.  Disabled for nacl due
    to lack of toolchain support.

gtk_version
    Current value (from the default) = 3
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:13

    The (major) version of GTK to build against.  A different version may be
    loaded at runtime.

has_native_accessibility
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:18

    Whether the platform provides a native accessibility toolkit, in other words
    the platform has a C/C++ interface for accessibility that Chrome
    implements/subclasses in some way - win, mac, linux.

has_platform_accessibility_support
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:26

    Whether the platform provide platform-specific accessibility implementation,
    i.e. there an accessibility API of some kind on this platform that's
    implemented in Chrome's browser process, but not necessarily something that
    looks like subclassing an interface - so that includes Android (the Java
    AccessibilityNodeProvider API) and Fuchsia (uses fidl messaging, kind of
    like mojo).

have_full_mixer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:51

    Set to true if there is a full mixer implementation; if not, we create a
    shim mixer service receiver that pushes audio to the CMA backend.

headless_fontconfig_utils
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:10

    Provide bindings for font loading for headless embedders.

headless_use_embedded_resources
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:7

    Embed resource.pak file into the binary for easier distribution.

headless_use_policy
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //headless/headless.gni:16

    Use Policy component to manage preferences.

headless_use_prefs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //headless/headless.gni:13

    Use Prefs component to access Local State and other preferences.

host_byteorder
    Current value (from the default) = "undefined"
      From //build/config/host_byteorder.gni:9

host_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_cpu`.)

host_os
    Current value (from the default) = "linux"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_os`.)

host_pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:36

    A optional pkg-config wrapper to use for tools built on the host.

host_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:151

    This should not normally be set as a build argument.  It's here so that
    every toolchain can pass through the "global" value via toolchain_args().

icu_disable_thin_archive
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:17

    If true, compile icu into a standalone static library. Currently this is
    only useful on Chrome OS.

icu_fuchsia_override_data_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:22

    If set to nonempty, this is the label of the directory to be used to pull
    the ICU data files content.  The setting has effect only when building
    inside the Fuchsia source tree.

icu_use_data_file
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:8

    Tells icu to load an external data file rather than rely on the icudata
    being linked directly into the binary.

icu_use_stub_data
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:13

    If true, then this creates a stub data file. This should be disabled if
    a custom data file will be used instead, in order to avoid conflicting
    symbols.

ignore_missing_widevine_signing_cert
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:81

    If set, and Widevine CDM host verification signing failed due to no signing
    cert, the failure will be ignored. Otherwise the build process will fail.
    Set to false by default for official build to catch missing cert error.
    For developers building with "is_official_build" locally without Widevine
    signing certs, please manually set `ignore_missing_widevine_signing_cert`
    to true to suppress the error.

include_ash_ambient_animation_resources
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ash/ambient/resources/resources.gni:16

    Build flag to include resources for the animated screensaver in ash builds.
   
    Currently, these resources are included by default for internal ChromeOS
    builds as both conditions below are prerequisites for downloading Lottie
    ambient mode resources from CIPD in the DEPS file.
   
    May be overridden locally to false for testing purposes if desired.

include_transport_security_state_preload_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:36

    Includes the transport security state preload list. This list includes
    mechanisms (e.g. HSTS, HPKP) to enforce trusted connections to a significant
    set of hardcoded domains. While this list has a several hundred KB of binary
    size footprint, this flag should not be disabled unless the embedder is
    willing to take the responsibility to make sure that all important
    connections use HTTPS.

include_vr_data
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:30

    Whether to include VR extras like test APKs in non-VR-specific targets

init_stack_vars
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:140

    Initialize all local variables with a pattern. This flag will fill
    uninitialized floating-point types (and 32-bit pointers) with 0xFF and the
    rest with 0xAA. This makes behavior of uninitialized memory bugs consistent,
    recognizable in the debugger, and crashes on memory accesses through
    uninitialized pointers.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1131993): Enabling this when 'is_android' is true breaks
    content_shell_test_apk on both ARM and x86.

internal_gles2_conform_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/gles2_conform_support/BUILD.gn:7

    Set to true to compile with the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance tests.

      From //build/config/ios/ios_sdk_overrides.gni:10

    Version of iOS that we're targeting.

ios_stack_profiler_enabled
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:73

    Control whether the ios stack sampling profiler is enabled. This flag is
    only supported on iOS 64-bit architecture, but some project build //base
    for 32-bit architecture.

iot_service_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:131

    Extra rpath to use for standalone services.

is_android_arc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:62

    Set to true for builds targeting ARC.

is_asan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:14

    Compile for Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs.

is_cast_audio_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:26

    Set this true for an audio-only Chromecast build.
    TODO(crbug.com/1293538): Replace with a buildflag for speaker-only builds not
    specific to Cast.

is_cast_desktop_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:20

is_castos
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:53

    Set this to true to build for Nest hardware running Linux (aka "CastOS").
    Set this to false to use the defaults for the target OS/platform.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1314528): Change default to false and require is_linux.

is_cfi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:53

    Compile with Control Flow Integrity to protect virtual calls and casts.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html
   
    TODO(pcc): Remove this flag if/when CFI is enabled in all official builds.

is_cfm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromeos/components/chromebox_for_meetings/buildflags/buildflags.gni:7

    True if compiling for Chromebox for Meeting devices.

is_chancie_wancie_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:18

is_chrome_branded
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:9

    Select the desired branding flavor. False means normal Chromium branding,
    true means official Google Chrome branding (requires extra Google-internal
    resources).

is_chromecast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:16

    DEPRECATED.  This flag will be removed in the future; see https://crbug.com/1219802.
   
    New code should use enable_cast_receiver if the feature in question is
    required for all Cast-enabled browsers, or an alternative buildflag if it is
    for specific types of devices.

is_chromeos_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:26

    Determines if we're building for a Chrome OS device (or VM) and not just
    linux-chromeos. NOTE: Most test targets in Chrome expect to run under
    linux-chromeos, so some have compile-time asserts that intentionally fail
    when this build flag is set. Build and run the tests for linux-chromeos
    instead.
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/chromeos_build_instructions.md
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/main/simple_chrome_workflow.md

is_chromeos_with_hw_details
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:34

    Determines if we collect hardware information in chrome://system and
    feedback logs. A similar build flag "hw_details" is defined in Chrome OS
    (see https://crrev.com/c/3123455).

is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:139

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.

is_component_build
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:18
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:168

    Component build. Setting to true compiles targets declared as "components"
    as shared libraries loaded dynamically. This speeds up development time.
    When false, components will be linked statically.
   
    For more information see
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/component_build.md

is_component_ffmpeg
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:38
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:51

    Set true to build ffmpeg as a shared library. NOTE: this means we should
    always consult is_component_ffmpeg instead of is_component_build for
    ffmpeg targets. This helps linux chromium packagers that swap out our
    ffmpeg.so with their own. See discussion here
    https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-packagers/R5rcZXWxBEQ/B6k0zzmJbvcJ

is_cronet_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ios/config.gni:16

    Control whether cronet is built (this is usually set by the script
    components/cronet/tools/cr_cronet.py as cronet requires specific
    gn args to build correctly).

is_ct_supported
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //services/network/public/cpp/features.gni:10

    Certificate transparency is not supported on iOS.
    TODO(mmenke): It's actually not supported on Android, either.

is_debug
    Current value = false
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:10
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:158

    Debug build. Enabling official builds automatically sets is_debug to false.

is_ggp
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:8

is_hwasan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:19

    Compile for Hardware-Assisted Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs
    (android/arm64 only).
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html

is_internal_chrome_cleaner_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/chrome_cleaner/chrome_cleaner_args.gni:9

    If this is true, the build will look for extra Google-internal resources.
    This should only be set on the Chrome Cleaner builders, not general
    chromium builders, since it can cause tests to take longer.

is_lsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:22

    Compile for Leak Sanitizer to find leaks.

is_msan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:25

    Compile for Memory Sanitizer to find uninitialized reads.

is_nacl_glibc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:12

    True if nacl_glibc is used.

is_nacl_saigo
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:15

    True if saigo_newlib is used.

is_official_build
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:9
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:136

    Set to enable the official build level of optimization. This has nothing
    to do with branding, but enables an additional level of optimization above
    release (!is_debug). This might be better expressed as a tri-state
    (debug, release, official) but for historical reasons there are two
    separate flags.
   
    IMPORTANT NOTE: (!is_debug) is *not* sufficient to get satisfying
    performance. In particular, DCHECK()s are still enabled for release builds,
    which can halve overall performance, and do increase memory usage. Always
    set "is_official_build" to true for any build intended to ship to end-users.

is_official_chrome_cleaner_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/chrome_cleaner/chrome_cleaner_args.gni:13

    If this is true, builds an official release of the Chrome Cleanup Tool
    (requires is_internal_chrome_cleaner_build=true).

is_on_release_branch
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/gni/release_branch_toggle.gni:6

is_p2p_enabled
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //services/network/public/cpp/features.gni:16

    Controls whether P2P is exposed by the network service.
    Optional to reduce avoid having Chrome on iOS depends on
    WebRTC and related third-party libraries (libvpx, libaom,
    ...).

is_perfetto_build_generator
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:82

    All the tools/gen_* scripts set this to true. This is mainly used to locate
    .gni files from //gn rather than //build.

is_perfetto_embedder
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:87

    This is for override via `gn args` (e.g. for tools/gen_xxx). Embedders
    based on GN (e.g. v8) should NOT set this and instead directly sets
    perfetto_build_with_embedder=true in their GN files.

is_reven
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:40

    Refers to the separate branding required for the reven build.

is_single_volume
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:66

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:32

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer to find various types of
    undefined behaviour (excludes vptr checks).

is_ubsan_no_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:35

    Halt the program if a problem is detected.

is_ubsan_null
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:38

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's null pointer checks.

is_ubsan_security
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:82

    Enables core ubsan security features. Will later be removed once it matches
    is_ubsan.

is_ubsan_vptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:118

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's vptr checks.

      From //base/BUILD.gn:60

    Unsafe developer build. Has developer-friendly features that may weaken or
    disable security measures like sandboxing or ASLR.
    IMPORTANT: Unsafe developer builds should never be distributed to end users.

is_win_arm64
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:120

    Currently Windows on Arm doesn't support OpenGL or Vulkan.

jsoncpp_no_deprecated_declarations
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/jsoncpp/BUILD.gn:11

    Allow individual projects to remove the warning suppression
    by overriding this in their .gn file or through custom args.gn
    See crbug.com/983223

ldso_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:20

libcxx_is_shared
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:55

    WARNING: Setting this to a non-default value is highly discouraged.
    If true, libc++ will be built as a shared library; otherwise libc++ will be
    linked statically. Setting this to something other than the default is
    unsupported and can be broken by libc++ rolls. Note that if this is set to
    true, you must also set libcxx_abi_unstable=false, which is bad for
    performance and memory use.

libcxx_natvis_include
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:30

    Builds libcxx Natvis into the symbols for type visualization.
    Set to false to workaround http://crbug.com/966676 and
    http://crbug.com/966687.

libcxx_revision
    Current value (from the default) = "79a2e924d96e2fc1e4b937c42efd08898fa472d7"
      From //buildtools/deps_revisions.gni:8

    Used to cause full rebuilds on libc++ rolls. This should be kept in sync
    with the libcxx_revision vars in //DEPS.

libyuv_disable_jpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:15

libyuv_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:14

libyuv_symbols_visible
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:19

    When building a shared library using a target in WebRTC or
    Chromium projects that depends on libyuv, setting this flag
    to true makes libyuv symbols visible inside that library.

libyuv_use_absl_flags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to false to disable building with absl flags.

libyuv_use_mmi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:22

libyuv_use_msa
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:20

libyuv_use_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:17

limit_android_deps
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:35

    Limits the defined //third_party/android_deps targets to only "buildCompile"
    and "buildCompileNoDeps" targets. This is useful for third-party
    repositories which do not use JUnit tests. For instance,
    limit_android_deps == true removes "gn gen" requirement for
    //third_party/robolectric .

link_pulseaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:19

    Allows distributions to link pulseaudio directly (DT_NEEDED) instead of
    using dlopen. This helps with automated detection of ABI mismatches and
    prevents silent errors.

llvm_force_head_revision
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:18

    If this is set to true, we use the revision in the llvm repo to determine
    the CLANG_REVISION to use, instead of the version hard-coded into
    //tools/clang/scripts/update.py. This should only be used in
    conjunction with setting the llvm_force_head_revision DEPS variable when
    `gclient runhooks` is run as well.

mac_sdk_min
    Current value (from the default) = "10.15"
      From //build/config/mac/mac_sdk_overrides.gni:12

make_partition_alloc_standalone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/partition_allocator/partition_alloc.gni:6

mbi_mode
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //content/common/features.gni:17

    Whether or not MBI mode (Multiple Blink Isolates) should be enabled,
    depending on the build argument.

      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:86

    unified flag to pick monotonic_clock OR monotonic_clock_raw

media_use_ffmpeg
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:28
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:24

    Enable usage of FFmpeg within the media library. Used for most software
    based decoding, demuxing, and sometimes optimized FFTs. If disabled,
    implementors must provide their own demuxers and decoders.

media_use_libvpx
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:29
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:28

    Enable usage of libvpx within the media library. Used for software based
    decoding of VP9 and VP8A type content.

media_use_openh264
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:38

    Enable usage of OpenH264 within the media library. Used for software based
    encoding of H264 content.

      From //build/config/mips.gni:13

    MIPS MultiMedia Instruction compilation flag.

mixer_in_cast_shell
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:55

    If true, the mixer will be instantiated inside cast_shell. When false, the
    mixer is expected to be running in another process.

mojo_media_host
    Current value (from the default) = "gpu"
      From //media/media_options.gni:247

    The process that the mojo MediaService runs in. By default, all services
    registered in |mojo_media_services| are hosted in the MediaService, with the
    exception that when |enable_library_cdms| is true, the "cdm" service will
    run in a separate CdmService in the CDM (utility) process, while other
    |mojo_media_services| still run in the MediaService in the process specified
    by "mojo_media_host".
    Valid options are:
    - "browser": Use mojo media service hosted in the browser process.
    - "gpu": Use mojo media service hosted in the gpu process.
    - "": Do not use mojo media service.

mojo_media_services
    Current value (from the default) = ["video_decoder", "cdm"]
      From //media/media_options.gni:235

    A list of mojo media services that should be used in the media pipeline.
    Valid entries in the list are:
    - "renderer": Use mojo-based media Renderer service.
    - "cdm": Use mojo-based Content Decryption Module.
    - "audio_decoder": Use mojo-based audio decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.
    - "video_decoder": Use mojo-based video decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.

mojom_message_id_salt_path
    Current value (from the default) = "//chrome/VERSION"
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:116

    The path to a file whose contents can be used as the basis for a message
    ID scrambling salt.

monolithic_binaries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:214

    Only for local development. When true the binaries (perfetto, traced, ...)
    are monolithic and don't use a common shared library. This is mainly to
    avoid LD_LIBRARY_PATH dances when testing locally.
    On Windows we default to monolithic executables, because pairing
    dllexport/import adds extra complexity for little benefit. Te only reason
    for monolithic_binaries=false is saving binary size, which matters mainly on
    Android. See also comments on PERFETTO_EXPORT_ENTRYPOINT in compiler.h.

msan_track_origins
    Current value (from the default) = 2
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:43

    Track where uninitialized memory originates from. From fastest to slowest:
    0 - no tracking, 1 - track only the initial allocation site, 2 - track the
    chain of stores leading from allocation site to use site.

msvc_use_sse2
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:69

    Enable SSE2 for MSVC builds. Ignored if it's not a MSVC build.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:99

needs_gomacc_path_arg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:14

    This flag is for ChromeOS compiler wrapper.
    By passing gomacc path via cmd-line arg, ChromeOS' compiler wrapper
    invokes gomacc inside it.

optimize_for_fuzzing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:90

    Optimize for coverage guided fuzzing (balance between speed and number of
    branches). Can be also used to remove non-determinism and other issues.

optimize_webui
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:20
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //ui/webui/webui_features.gni:11

    Optimize parts of Chrome's UI written with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
    for runtime performance purposes. This does more work at compile time for
    speed benefits at runtime (so we skip in debug builds).

optional_trace_events_enabled
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/trace_event/tracing.gni:20

ozone_auto_platforms
    Current value (from the default) = true

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:16

    Build PDFium either:
    1) When set to true, with a bundled FreeType, built from FreeType source
       code in //third_party/freetype and PDFium's FreeType configs in
       third_party/freetype/include.
    2) When set to false, use whatever FreeType target is defined in
       //build/config/freetype.

pdf_enable_click_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:19

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:51

    Build a complete static library

pdf_is_standalone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:48

    paths.

perfetto_build_with_android
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:78

    The Android blueprint file generator set this to true (as well as
    is_perfetto_build_generator). This is just about being built in the
    Android tree (AOSP and internal) and is NOT related with the target OS.
    In standalone Android builds and Chromium Android builds, this is false.

perfetto_enable_git_rev_version_header
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:247

perfetto_force_dcheck
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:229

    Whether DCHECKs should be enabled or not. Values: "on" | "off" | "".
    By default ("") DCHECKs are enabled only:
    - If DCHECK_ALWAYS_ON is defined (which is mainly a Chromium-ism).
    - On debug builds (i.e. if NDEBUG is NOT defined) but only in Chromium,
      Android and standalone builds.
    - On all other builds (e.g., SDK) it's off regardless of NDEBUG (unless
      DCHECK_ALWAYS_ON is defined).
    See base/logging.h for the implementation of all this.

perfetto_force_dlog
    Current value (from the default) = "off"
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:219

    Whether DLOG should be enabled on debug builds (""), all builds ("on"), or
    none ("off"). We disable it by default for embedders to avoid spamming their
    console.

perfetto_use_system_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:316

    Used by CrOS system builds. Uses the system version of protobuf
    from /usr/include instead of the hermetic one.

perfetto_use_system_zlib
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:318

perfetto_verbose_logs_enabled
    Current value (from the default) = false

pgo_data_path
    Current value = "/media/alex/linuz/home/alex/chromium/src/chrome/build/pgo_profiles/chrome-win64-main-1653123517-84b6a91c74c02edc7650c1735aac3607369bdd63.profdata"
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:61
    Overridden from the default = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:24

    When using chrome_pgo_phase = 2, read profile data from this path.

pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:33

    A pkg-config wrapper to call instead of trying to find and call the right
    pkg-config directly. Wrappers like this are common in cross-compilation
    environments.
    Leaving it blank defaults to searching PATH for 'pkg-config' and relying on
    the sysroot mechanism to find the right .pc files.

print_unsymbolized_stack_traces
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/third_party/symbolize/BUILD.gn:13

    Stack traces will not include function names. Instead they will contain
    file and offset information that can be used with
    tools/valgrind/asan/asan_symbolize.py. By piping stderr through this script,
    and also enabling symbol_level = 2, you can get much more detailed stack
    traces with file names and line numbers, even in non-ASAN builds.

proprietary_codecs
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:35
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:26

    Enables proprietary codecs and demuxers; e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, and MP4.
    We always build Google Chrome and Chromecast with proprietary codecs.
   
    Note: this flag is used by WebRTC which is DEPSed into Chrome. Moving it
    out of //build will require using the build_overrides directory.

put_ref_count_in_previous_slot
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/allocator.gni:106

    If BRP is enabled, additional options are available:
    - put_ref_count_in_previous_slot: place the ref-count at the end of the
      previous slot (or in metadata if a slot starts on the page boundary), as
      opposed to the beginning of the slot.
    - enable_backup_ref_ptr_slow_checks: enable additional safety checks that
      are too expensive to have on by default.
    - enable_dangling_raw_ptr_checks: enable checking raw_ptr do not become
      dangling during their lifetime.

rbe_cc_cfg_file
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/rbe.gni:23

    Set to the path of the RBE reclient configuration file.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //remoting/build/config/remoting_features.gni:8

    Determines whether or not remoting should use wayland implementation
    to talk to remote host.

remoting_webrtc_verbose_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //remoting/build/config/remoting_logging.gni:13

    Enabling this will cause WebRTC's LS_INFO and LS_VERBOSE (level 1)
    messages to appear in the debug log output. Note that WebRTC's
    "VERBOSE1" messages are very spammy and it is impossible to
    separately filter LS_INFO and LS_VERBOSE messages (see
    third_party/webrtc_overrides/rtc_base/). So a separate GN option is
    provided here, to allow this logging to be quickly enabled for Debug
    or Release builds.

remoting_wix_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //remoting/host/installer/win/wix_path.gni:9

    Absolute directory containing the wix binary.

    checkout to add additional targets without explicitly changing any checked-
    in files.

rtc_audio_device_plays_sinus_tone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:191

    When set to true, replace the audio output with a sinus tone at 440Hz.
    The ADM will ask for audio data from WebRTC but instead of reading real
    audio samples from NetEQ, a sinus tone will be generated and replace the
    real audio samples.

rtc_build_dcsctp
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:307

    Enable the dcsctp backend for DataChannels and related unittests

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:165

rtc_builtin_ssl_root_certificates
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:88

    Setting this to false will require the API user to pass in their own
    SSLCertificateVerifier to verify the certificates presented from a
    TLS-TURN server. In return disabling this saves around 100kb in the binary.

rtc_disable_check_msg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:295

    Set this to true to disable detailed error message and logging for
    RTC_CHECKs.

rtc_disable_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:288

    Set this to true to fully remove logging from WebRTC.

rtc_disable_metrics
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:298

    Set this to true to disable webrtc metrics.

rtc_disable_trace_events
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:291

    Set this to true to disable trace events.

rtc_dlog_always_on
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:51

    Setting this to true, will make RTC_DLOG() expand to log statements instead
    of being removed by the preprocessor.
    This is useful for example to be able to get RTC_DLOGs on a release build.

rtc_enable_android_aaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:148

    Experimental: enable use of Android AAudio which requires Android SDK 26 or above
    and NDK r16 or above.

      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:123

    Set this to true to enable BWE test logging.

rtc_enable_external_auth
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:113

    Enable when an external authentication mechanism is used for performing
    packet authentication for RTP packets instead of libsrtp.

rtc_enable_grpc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:310

    Enable gRPC used for negotiation in multiprocess tests

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:260

rtc_enable_objc_symbol_export
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:58

    Setting this to true will make RTC_OBJC_EXPORT expand to code that will
    manage symbols visibility. By default, Obj-C/Obj-C++ symbols are exported
    if C++ symbols are but setting this arg to true while keeping
    rtc_enable_symbol_export=false will only export RTC_OBJC_EXPORT
    annotated symbols.

rtc_enable_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:241

    Enables the use of protocol buffers for debug recordings.

rtc_enable_sctp

      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:244

    Set this to disable building with support for SCTP data channels.

rtc_enable_symbol_export
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:44

    Setting this to true will make RTC_EXPORT (see rtc_base/system/rtc_export.h)
    expand to code that will manage symbols visibility.

rtc_enable_win_wgc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:226

    When set to true, a capturer implementation that uses the
    Windows.Graphics.Capture APIs will be available for use. This introduces a
    dependency on the Win 10 SDK v10.0.17763.0.

rtc_exclude_audio_processing_module
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:120

    Selects whether the audio processing module should be excluded.

rtc_exclude_field_trial_default
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:68

    When WebRTC is built as part of Chromium it should exclude the default
    implementation of field_trial unless it is building for NACL or
    Chromecast.

rtc_exclude_metrics_default
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:77

    Setting this to true will define WEBRTC_EXCLUDE_METRICS_DEFAULT which
    will tell the pre-processor to remove the default definition of symbols
    needed to use metrics. In that case a new implementation needs to be
    provided.

rtc_exclude_system_time
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:83

    Setting this to true will define WEBRTC_EXCLUDE_SYSTEM_TIME which
    will tell the pre-processor to remove the default definition of the
    SystemTimeNanos() which is defined in rtc_base/system_time.cc. In
    that case a new implementation needs to be provided.

rtc_exclude_transient_suppressor
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:302

    Set this to true to exclude the transient suppressor in the audio processing
    module from the build.

rtc_include_builtin_audio_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:207

    When set to false, builtin audio encoder/decoder factories and all the
    audio codecs they depend on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_builtin_video_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:213

    When set to false, builtin video encoder/decoder factories and all the
    video codecs they depends on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_dav1d_in_internal_decoder_factory
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:229

    Includes the dav1d decoder in the internal decoder factory when set to true.

rtc_include_ilbc
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:48
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:91

    Include the iLBC audio codec?

rtc_include_internal_audio_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:269

    Chromium uses its own IO handling, so the internal ADM is only built for
    standalone WebRTC.

rtc_include_opus
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:94

    Disable this to avoid building the Opus audio codec.

rtc_include_pulse_audio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:265

    Excluded in Chromium since its prerequisites don't require Pulse Audio.

rtc_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:281

    Set this to true to build the unit tests.

      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:250

rtc_link_pipewire
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:141

    Set this to link PipeWire and required libraries directly instead of using the dlopen.

rtc_opus_support_120ms_ptime
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:98

    Enable this if the Opus version upon which WebRTC is built supports direct
    encoding of 120 ms packets.

rtc_opus_variable_complexity
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:101

    Enable this to let the Opus audio codec change complexity on the fly.

rtc_prefer_fixed_point
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:158

    Selects fixed-point code where possible.

rtc_sanitize_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:155

    Set to "func", "block", "edge" for coverage generation.
    At unit test runtime set UBSAN_OPTIONS="coverage=1".
    It is recommend to set include_examples=0.
    Use llvm's sancov -html-report for human readable reports.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html .

    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:109

    Used to specify an external OpenSSL include path when not compiling the
    library that comes with WebRTC (i.e. rtc_build_ssl == 0).

rtc_use_absl_mutex
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:181

    Enable this flag to make webrtc::Mutex be implemented by absl::Mutex.

rtc_use_dummy_audio_file_devices
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:185

    By default, use normal platform audio support or dummy audio, but don't
    use file-based audio playout and record.

rtc_use_h264
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:47
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:178

rtc_use_pipewire
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:138

    Set this to use PipeWire on the Wayland display server.
    By default it's only enabled on desktop Linux (excludes ChromeOS) and
    only when using the sysroot as PipeWire is not available in older and
    supported Ubuntu and Debian distributions.

rtc_use_x11
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:132

    Set this to false to skip building code that requires X11.

rtc_use_x11_extensions
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:285

    Set this to false to skip building code that also requires X11 extensions
    such as Xdamage, Xfixes.

rtc_win_undef_unicode
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:221

    When set to true and in a standalone build, it will undefine UNICODE and
    _UNICODE (which are always defined globally by the Chromium Windows
    toolchain).
    This is only needed for testing purposes, WebRTC wants to be sure it
    doesn't assume /DUNICODE and /D_UNICODE but that it explicitly uses
    wide character functions.

runtime_call_stats_count_everything
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/platform/BUILD.gn:189

rust_sysroot_absolute
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/rust.gni:40

    Chromium currently has a Rust toolchain for Android and Linux, but
    if you wish to experiment on more platforms you can use this
    argument to specify an alternative toolchain.
    This should be an absolute path to a directory
    containing a 'bin' directory and others. Commonly
    <home dir>/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-<something>-<something>

rustc_can_link
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/rust.gni:73

    Rust code may end up being linked into a final executable by:
    * rustc (which calls lld)
    * our pre-existing C++ linker invocations
    At the moment, this first pipeline is incompatible with the ldflags we use
    for thin LTO, due to some problem in escaping gn rules. There's a further
    problem with -lunwind on Android.
    However, Rust code is still useful if it's contributing to our existing
    C++ linker invocations, so this doesn't disable Rust entirely. It does
    disable Rust unit test executables, so we do need to fix this.
    https://crbug.com/1229423
    NB this may be overridden by individual toolchains

rustc_version
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/rust.gni:32

    The version string returned by rustc -V, if using an alternative toolchain.

safe_browsing_mode
    Current value (from the default) = 1
      From //components/safe_browsing/buildflags.gni:20

sample_profile_is_accurate
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:147

    Whether we should consider the profile we're using to be accurate. Accurate
    profiles have the benefit of (potentially substantial) binary size
    reductions, by instructing the compiler to optimize cold and uncovered
    functions heavily for size. This often comes at the cost of performance.

sanitizer_coverage_flags
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:100

    Value for -fsanitize-coverage flag. Setting this causes
    use_sanitizer_coverage to be enabled.
    This flag is not used for libFuzzer (use_libfuzzer=true). Instead, we use:
        -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link
    Default value when unset and use_fuzzing_engine=true:
        trace-pc-guard
    Default value when unset and use_sanitizer_coverage=true:
        trace-pc-guard,indirect-calls

seed_corpus_dir

      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:177

    Enable -H, which prints the include tree during compilation.
    For use by tools/clang/scripts/analyze_includes.py

single_module_mode_handle_verifier
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/win/BUILD.gn:11

      From //skia/features.gni:8

skip_archive_compression
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/installer/mini_installer/BUILD.gn:22

    The Chrome archive is compressed in official builds to reduce the size of
    the installer. By default: non-official or component builds, a build mode
    targeting developers, do not compress so as to provide quicker build-test
    cycles.

skip_buildtools_check
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:312

    Skip buildtools dependency checks (needed for ChromeOS).

strip_debug_info
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:65

    Android-only: Strip the debug info of libraries within lib.unstripped to
    reduce size. As long as symbol_level > 0, this will still allow stacks to be
    symbolized.

subpixel_font_rendering_disabled
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/ipc/service/BUILD.gn:13

supports_llvm
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/Reactor/reactor.gni:17

supports_subzero
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/Reactor/reactor.gni:13

    Subzero doesn't support ARM64, MIPS64, PPC64, and RISCV64 (only x86 and ARMv7a).

swiftshader_optimized_debug_build
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/swiftshader.gni:23

    By default, build SwiftShader with optimizations enabled in debug
    for performance reasons. Set to false to build as unoptimized.

swiftshader_startup_dialog
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/swiftshader.gni:27

    If enabled, debug builds on Windows will pop up a dialog when the
    SwiftShader DLL gets loaded, to facilitate attaching a debugger.

symbol_level
    Current value = 0
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:19
    Overridden from the default = -1
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:60

    How many symbols to include in the build. This affects the performance of
    the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only. Symbols with
    internal linkage (static functions or those in anonymous namespaces) may not
    appear when using this level.
      0 means no symbols.
      -1 means auto-set according to debug/release and platform.

sync_user_agent_product
    Current value (from the default) = "Chrome"
      From //components/sync/base/BUILD.gn:10

system_headers_in_deps
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/gcc_toolchain.gni:34

    Use -MD instead of -MMD for compiler commands. This is useful for tracking
    the comprehensive set of dependencies.

system_libdir
    Current value (from the default) = "lib"
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:47

    CrOS systemroots place pkgconfig files at <systemroot>/usr/share/pkgconfig
    and one of <systemroot>/usr/lib/pkgconfig or <systemroot>/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
    depending on whether the systemroot is for a 32 or 64 bit architecture.
   
    When build under GYP, CrOS board builds specify the 'system_libdir' variable
    as part of the GYP_DEFINES provided by the CrOS emerge build or simple
    chrome build scheme. This variable permits controlling this for GN builds
    in similar fashion by setting the `system_libdir` variable in the build's
    args.gn file to 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate for the target architecture.

system_wayland_scanner_path
    Current value (from the default) = "/usr/bin/wayland-scanner"

target_environment
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/ios/config.gni:11

    Configure the environment for which to build. Could be either "device",
    "simulator" or "catalyst". If unspecified, then it will be assumed to be
    "simulator" if the target_cpu is "x68" or "x64", "device" otherwise. The
    default is only there for compatibility reasons and will be removed (see
    crbug.com/1138425 for more details).

target_os

      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:26

    possible values for target_winuwp_version:
      "10" - Windows UWP 10
      "8.1" - Windows RT 8.1
      "8.0" - Windows RT 8.0

tests_have_location_tags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //testing/test.gni:23

    Some component repos (e.g. ANGLE) import //testing but do not have
    "location_tags.json", and so we don't want to try and upload the tags
    for their tests.
    And, some build configs may simply turn off generation altogether.

thin_lto_enable_optimizations
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:59
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:129

      From //third_party/dawn/tint_overrides_with_defaults.gni:62

toolkit_views
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:33

    True means the UI is built using the "views" framework.

treat_warnings_as_errors
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:50

    Default to warnings as errors for default workflow, where we catch
    warnings with known toolchains. Allow overriding this e.g. for Chromium
    builds on Linux that could use a different version of the compiler.
    With GCC, warnings in no-Chromium code are always not treated as errors.

trial_comparison_cert_verifier_supported
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //net/features.gni:40

    Platforms where the cert verifier comparison trial is supported.
    See https://crbug.com/649026.

      From //media/media_options.gni:129

use_amdgpu_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:17

use_android_unwinder_v2
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:33

    Set to true to use the android unwinder V2 implementation.

use_android_user_agent
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:91

    Include 'Android' in user agent string to avoid being served desktop
    versions of websites.
    TODO(halliwell): consider making this default for all Cast hardware.

use_arc_protected_media
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/gpu/args.gni:44

    Indicates if the ChromeOS protected media functionality should also be
    utilized by HW video decoding for ARC.

use_asan_backup_ref_ptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/allocator.gni:115

use_aura
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:28

    Indicates if Aura is enabled. Aura is a low-level windowing library, sort
    of a replacement for GDI or GTK.

use_backup_ref_ptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/allocator.gni:89

    Set use_backup_ref_ptr true to use BackupRefPtr (BRP) as the implementation
    of raw_ptr<T>, and enable PartitionAlloc support for it.

use_blink_extensions_chromeos
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/config.gni:49

    If true, the experimental renderer extensions library will be used.

use_bluez
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //device/bluetooth/cast_bluetooth.gni:5

use_bundled_fontconfig
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/fontconfig/fontconfig.gni:11

use_bundled_weston
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/ozone/platform/wayland/wayland.gni:14

    Checks if Weston must be compiled

use_cfi_cast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:115

    Enable checks for bad casts: derived cast and unrelated cast.
    TODO(krasin): remove this, when we're ready to add these checks by default.
    https://crbug.com/626794

use_cfi_diag
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:64

    Print detailed diagnostics when Control Flow Integrity detects a violation.

use_cfi_icall
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:61

use_cfi_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:68

    Let Control Flow Integrity continue execution instead of crashing when
    printing diagnostics (use_cfi_diag = true).

use_chromecast_cdms
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:197

use_chromeos_protected_av1
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/gpu/args.gni:49

    Indicates if ChromeOS protected media supports the AV1 codec. By default
    H.264, VP9 and HEVC are enabled if protected media is enabled; AV1 is
    optional.

use_chromeos_protected_media
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/gpu/args.gni:40

    Indicates if ChromeOS protected media support exists. This is used
    to enable the CDM daemon in Chrome OS as well as support for
    encrypted content with HW video decoders.
    TODO(jkardatzke): Enable this for Lacros always, it is determined at runtime
    in that configuration.

use_chromium_rust_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:29

    Use experimental Rust toolchain built in-tree. See //tools/rust. For now,
    only use it for linux targets. The package only has prebuilt libs for linux.
    More targets will be added later.
   
    Ideally this should check `current_os` so that e.g. Android builds will use
    the Android toolchain for target artifacts and the Chromium Rust toolchain
    for host artifacts. Currently there is an std mixup in //build/rust/std that
    prevents this.
   
    TODO(https://crbug.com/1245714): fix std handling and check `current_os`.

use_clang_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:23

use_clang_diagnostics_format
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:43

    Set this to use clang-style diagnostics format instead of MSVC-style, which
    is useful in e.g. Emacs compilation mode.
    E.g.:
     Without this, clang emits a diagnostic message like this:
       foo/bar.cc(12,34): error: something went wrong
     and with this switch, clang emits it like this:
       foo/bar.cc:12:34: error: something went wrong

use_clang_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/profiling/profiling.gni:10

use_clang_profiling_inside_sandbox
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:180

use_command_buffer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:14

use_cras
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:44

    Override to dynamically link the cras (ChromeOS audio) library.

use_crash_key_stubs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/crash/core/common/BUILD.gn:11

    If set to true, this will stub out and disable the entire crash key system.

use_cups
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:27

use_cups_ipp
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:51

    Enables the CUPS IPP printing backend.
    TODO(crbug.com/226176): Remove this after CUPS PPD API calls are removed.

use_custom_libcxx
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:15

use_custom_libcxx_for_host
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:25

    Use libc++ instead of stdlibc++ when using the host_cpu toolchain, even if
    use_custom_libcxx is false. This is useful for cross-compiles where a custom
    toolchain for the target_cpu has been set as the default toolchain, but
    use_custom_libcxx should still be true when building for the host.  The
    expected usage is to set use_custom_libcxx=false and
    use_custom_libcxx_for_host=true in the passed in buildargs.

use_cxx11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:89

    Allow projects that wish to stay on C++11 to override Chromium's default.

use_dawn
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/gl/features.gni:21

    Should Dawn support be compiled to back the WebGPU implementation?
    Also controls linking Dawn depedencies in such as SPIRV-Tools/SPIRV-Cross.

use_dbus
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:31

use_debug_fission
    Current value (from the default) = "default"
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:81

    use_debug_fission: whether to use split DWARF debug info
    files. This can reduce link time significantly, but is incompatible
    with some utilities such as icecc and ccache. Requires gold and
    gcc >= 4.8 or clang.
    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission
   
    This is a placeholder value indicating that the code below should set
    the default.  This is necessary to delay the evaluation of the default
    value expression until after its input values such as use_gold have
    been set, e.g. by a toolchain_args() block.

use_dummy_lastchange
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/util/lastchange.gni:9

use_dwarf5
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:165

    Enable DWARF v5.

use_egl
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/gl/features.gni:17

use_external_fuzzing_engine
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:78

    Compile for fuzzing with an external engine (e.g., Grammarinator).

      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:18

use_fake_binary_experiment
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/allocator.gni:113

    Registers the binary for a fake binary A/B experiment. The binaries built
    with this flag have no behavior difference, except for setting a synthetic
    Finch.

use_full_pdb_paths
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:173

    Override this to put full paths to PDBs in Windows PE files. This helps
    windbg and Windows Performance Analyzer with finding the PDBs in some local-
    build scenarios. This is never needed for bots or official builds. Because
    this puts the output directory in the DLLs/EXEs it breaks build determinism.
    Bugs have been reported to the windbg/WPA teams and this workaround will be
    removed when they are fixed.

use_gcm_from_platform
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/gcm_driver/config.gni:8

    Use native GCM driver for all non-Android builds. On Android, the platform
    includes GMS which provides the GCM client.

use_ghash
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:119

    Turn this on to use ghash feature of lld for faster debug link on Windows.
    http://blog.llvm.org/2018/01/improving-link-time-on-windows-with.html

use_gio
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:33

use_glib
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:36

use_gnome_keyring
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/os_crypt/features.gni:11

    Whether to use libgnome-keyring (deprecated by libsecret).
    See http://crbug.com/466975 and http://crbug.com/355223.

use_gold
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:221

    Whether to use the gold linker from binutils instead of lld or bfd.

use_goma
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:9

    Set to true to enable distributed compilation using Goma.

use_goma_rust
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:60

    Use goma for Rust builds. Experimental. The only known problem is
    b/193072381, but then again, we don't expect a build speedup before much
    more work is done.

use_goma_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:95

    If true, use Goma for ThinLTO code generation where applicable.

use_gtk
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:9

    Whether or not we should use libgtk.

use_icf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:190

    Set to true to use icf, Identical Code Folding.
   
    icf=all is broken in older golds, see
    https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17704
    chromeos binutils has been patched with the fix, so always use icf there.
    The bug only affects x86 and x64, so we can still use ICF when targeting
    other architectures.
   
    lld doesn't have the bug.

use_intel_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:19

use_internal_autofill_patterns
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/autofill/core/browser/BUILD.gn:30

    Normally, only branded builds use Google-internal sets of parsing patterns.
   
    Setting the variable 'use_internal_autofill_patterns' in args.gn overrides
    this default.

use_internal_isolated_origins
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/site_isolation/BUILD.gn:18

    Normally, only Google Chrome Android and Fuchsia WebEngine builds will use
    a Google-internal list of isolated origins defined below.
    If other Fuchsia embedders are added, the associated logic may need to be
    updated. See crbug.com/1179087.
   
    You can set the variable 'use_internal_isolated_origins' to true to use this
    Google-internal list of isolated origins even in a developer build.  Setting
    this variable explicitly to true will cause your build to fail if the
    internal file is missing.

use_jacoco_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:27

    Enables JaCoCo Java code coverage.

use_java_goma
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:26

    TODO(crbug.com/726475): true if use_goma = true in the future.

use_kerberos
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:19

    Enable Kerberos authentication. It is disabled by default on iOS, Fuchsia
    and Chromecast, at least for now. This feature needs configuration
    (krb5.conf and so on).
    TODO(fuchsia): Enable kerberos on Fuchsia when it's implemented there.

use_large_pdbs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:48

    Indicates whether to use /pdbpagesize:8192 to allow PDBs larger than 4 GiB.
    This requires updated debugging and profiling tools which are not widely
    distributed yet which is why it is currently opt-in.

use_layout_plugin
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/core/BUILD.gn:86

    Set to true to enable the clang layout plugin that help you to follow the

      From //third_party/libgav1/options.gni:14

use_libinput
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:37

    Determines if we're willing to link against libinput

use_libjpeg_turbo
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libjpeg.gni:11

    Uses libjpeg_turbo as the jpeg implementation. Has no effect if
    use_system_libjpeg is set.

use_libpci
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/angle/BUILD.gn:28

    Use the PCI lib to collect GPU information on Linux.

use_lld
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:22
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:42

    Set to true to use lld, the LLVM linker.
    In late bring-up on macOS (see docs/mac_lld.md).
    Tentatively used on iOS, except in cronet builds (cronet still supports
    32-bit builds, which lld doesn't support).
    The default linker everywhere else.

use_locally_built_instrumented_libraries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:47

    Use dynamic libraries instrumented by one of the sanitizers instead of the
    standard system libraries. Set this flag to build the libraries from source.

use_low_quality_image_interpolation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/config.gni:43

    If true, defaults image interpolation to low quality.

use_lto_in_rustc_linking
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:55

    Use LTO when using rustc to link binaries. Experimental. Currently incompatible
    with the options we use in our C++ toolchain to split LTO units.
    This has no effect on the production of normal Chrome binaries, which are
    linked by clang/lld rather than rustc.
    https://crbug.com/1229419

use_marvell_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:20

use_mte_checked_ptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/allocator.gni:91

use_nss_certs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //crypto/features.gni:9

    True if NSS is used for certificate handling.

use_official_enterprise_connectors_api_keys
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/browser/BUILD.gn:66

    You can set the variable 'use_official_enterprise_connectors_api_keys' to
    true to use the Google-internal file containing official API keys
    for enterprise connector partners even in a developer build.  Setting this
    variable explicitly to true will cause your build to fail if the
    internal file is missing.
   
    Note that official builds always behave as if the variable
    was explicitly set to true, i.e. they always use official keys,
    and will fail to build if the internal file is missing.

use_official_google_api_keys
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:33

    You can set the variable 'use_official_google_api_keys' to true
    to use the Google-internal file containing official API keys
    for Google Chrome even in a developer build.  Setting this
    variable explicitly to true will cause your build to fail if the
    internal file is missing.
   
    The variable is documented here, but not handled in this file;
    see //google_apis/determine_use_official_keys.gypi for the
    implementation.
   
    Set the variable to false to not use the internal file, even when
    it exists in your checkout.
   
    Leave it unset or set to "" to have the variable
    implicitly set to true if you have
    src/google_apis/internal/google_chrome_api_keys.h in your
    checkout, and implicitly set to false if not.
   
    Note that official builds always behave as if the variable
    was explicitly set to true, i.e. they always use official keys,
    and will fail to build if the internal file is missing.

use_ozone
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:13

use_pangocairo
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/linux/pangocairo/pangocairo.gni:9

use_partition_alloc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/allocator/allocator.gni:61

    Whether PartitionAlloc should be available for use or not.
    true makes PartitionAlloc linked to the executable or shared library and
    makes it available for use. It doesn't mean that the default allocator
    is PartitionAlloc, which is governed by |use_allocator|.
   
    This flag is currently set to false only on Cronet bots, because Cronet
    doesn't use PartitionAlloc at all, and doesn't wish to incur the library
    size increase (crbug.com/674570).

use_perfetto_client_library
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:28

    Switches the TRACE_EVENT instrumentation from base's TraceLog implementation
    to //third_party/perfetto's client library. Not implemented yet, currently a
    no-op to set up trybot infrastructure.
    TODO(crbug/1006769): Switch to perfetto's client library.

use_platform_icu_alternatives
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //url/features.gni:10

    Enables the use of ICU alternatives in lieu of ICU for the target toolchain.
    The flag is used for Cronet to reduce the size of the Cronet binary.

use_pulseaudio
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:140

use_qt
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/qt/qt.gni:7

    https://crbug.com/1317782 enable QT UI by default on Linux.

use_radeon_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:24

use_rbe
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/rbe.gni:17

    Set to true to enable remote compilation using reclient (deprecated).

use_real_dbus_clients
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromeos/dbus/config/use_real_dbus_clients.gni:9

    Instantiate real D-Bus clients instead of fakes.

use_remoteexec
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/rbe.gni:14

    Set to true to enable remote compilation using reclient.

use_rockchip_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:25

use_rts
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rts.gni:4

    For more info about RTS, please see
    //docs/testing/regression-test-selection.md

use_rtti
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:80

    Build with C++ RTTI enabled. Chromium builds without RTTI by default,
    but some sanitizers are known to require it, like CFI diagnostics
    and UBsan variants.

use_runtime_vlog
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/logging.gni:31

    Use runtime vlog everywhere except for ash-chrome.
    When `use_runtime_vlog` is true,
      command line switch `--vmodule=xxx` or `--v=x` could be used to
      control vlog level at runtime.
    when `use_runtime_volog` is false,
      verbose log level is controlled by `ENABLE_VLOG_LEVEL` macro. VLOG(n)
      is kept and generate output if `n` is less than or equal to the vlog
      level defined by the macro.
      Command line switch `--vmodule=xxx`, or `--v=x` would have no effect.
   
    Runtime vlog is used everywhere except on ash-chrome.
    Ash-chrome has a few vmodule patterns that need to be used indefinitely
    to investigate problems from logs in feedback reports. These vmodule
    patterns are using too much cpu cycles (see http://crbug/489441). Turning
    off runtime vlog and using build time vlog would avoid paying that cpu tax
    and have a nice side effect of a smaller production binary.

use_sanitizer_configs_without_instrumentation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:105

    When enabled, only relevant sanitizer defines are set, but compilation
    happens with no extra flags. This is useful when in component build
    enabling sanitizers only in some of the components.

use_sanitizer_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:169

use_static_angle
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/gl/features.gni:12

    Should ANGLE be linked statically?

use_swiftshader_with_subzero
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/Reactor/reactor.gni:27

    Subzero produces much smaller binaries, so always use it when available,
    except for MSan builds which only get Reactor code instrumented with LLVM.

use_synaptics_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:26

use_sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:24

    Controls default is_linux sysroot. If set to true, and sysroot
    is empty, default sysroot is calculated.

use_system_crash_handler
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chromecast/chromecast.gni:138

    Set to true to forward crashes to the system's crash handler instead of
    handling them internally.  This disables the built-in crash handler.

use_system_freetype
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/freetype/freetype.gni:13

    Blink needs a recent and properly build-configured FreeType version to
    support OpenType variations, color emoji and avoid security bugs. By default
    we ship and link such a version as part of Chrome. For distributions that
    prefer to keep linking to the version the system, FreeType must be newer
    than version 2.7.1 and have color bitmap support compiled in. WARNING:
    System FreeType configurations other than as described WILL INTRODUCE TEXT
    RENDERING AND SECURITY REGRESSIONS.

use_system_harfbuzz
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/harfbuzz-ng/harfbuzz.gni:11

    Blink uses a cutting-edge version of Harfbuzz; most Linux distros do not
    contain a new enough version of the code to work correctly. However,
    ChromeOS chroots (i.e, real ChromeOS builds for devices) do contain a
    new enough version of the library, and so this variable exists so that
    ChromeOS can build against the system lib and keep binary sizes smaller.

use_system_lcms2
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:60

    Don't build against bundled lcms2.

use_system_libdrm
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/linux/libdrm/BUILD.gn:14

    Controls whether the build should use the version of libdrm library shipped
    with the system. In release builds of desktop Linux and Chrome OS we use the
    system version. Some Chromecast devices use this as well.

use_system_libjpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libjpeg.gni:7

    Uses system libjpeg. If true, overrides use_libjpeg_turbo.

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:66

    Don't build against bundled libpng.

use_system_libsync
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libsync/BUILD.gn:13

    Controls whether the build should use the version of libsync
    library shipped with the system. In release builds of Chrome OS we
    use the system version, but when building on dev workstations we
    bundle it because Ubuntu doesn't ship a usable version.

use_system_libwayland
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/wayland/features.gni:12

    Controls whether the build should use the version of Wayland
    library shipped with the system or Chromium third_party.

use_system_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:15

    Controls whether the build should use the version of minigbm library shipped
    with the system. In release builds of desktop Linux and Chrome OS we use the
    system version.

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:57

    Don't build against bundled zlib.

use_tegra_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/minigbm/BUILD.gn:27

use_text_section_splitting
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:149

    This argument is to control whether enabling text section splitting in the
    final binary. When enabled, the separated text sections with prefix
    '.text.hot', '.text.unlikely', '.text.startup' and '.text.exit' will not be
    merged to '.text' section. This allows us to identify the hot code section
    ('.text.hot') in the binary which may be mlocked or mapped to huge page to
    reduce TLB misses which gives performance improvement on cpu usage.
    The gold linker by default has text section splitting enabled.

use_thin_lto
    Current value = true
      From //out/thorium/args.gn:58
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:89

use_vaapi
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/gpu/args.gni:32

    Indicates if VA-API-based hardware acceleration is to be used. This
    is typically the case on x86-based ChromeOS devices.
    VA-API should also be compiled by default on x11-using linux devices
    using x86/x64.

use_vaapi_image_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/gpu/args.gni:69

    VA-API also allows decoding of images, but we don't want to use this
    outside of chromeos, even if video decoding is enabled.

use_vaapi_x11
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/gpu/args.gni:12

use_vc4_minigbm
    Current value (from the default) = false

use_viz_debugger
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/viz/common/debugger/viz_debugger.gni:8

    Indicates if the Viz Debugger is enabled. This is disabled by default on
    official builds due to security and performance reasons.

    Provides the given V8 log file as an input to mksnapshot, where it can be
    used for profile-guided optimization of builtins.
   
    To do profile-guided optimizations of builtins:
    1. Build with v8_enable_builtins_profiling = true
    2. Run your chosen workload with the --turbo-profiling-log-builtins flag.
       For Chrome, the invocation might look like this:
         chrome --no-sandbox --disable-extensions
           --js-flags="--turbo-profiling-log-builtins --logfile=path/to/v8.log"
           "http://localhost/test-suite"
    3. Run tools/get_hints.py to produce the branch hints, selecting min_count
       and threshold_ratio as you wish.

    Override global symbol level setting for v8.

v8_target_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:33

    This arg is used when we want to tell the JIT-generating v8 code
    that we want to have it generate for an architecture that is different
    than the architecture that v8 will actually run on; we then run the
    code under an emulator. For example, we might run v8 on x86, but
    generate arm code and run that under emulation.
   
    This arg is defined here rather than in the v8 project because we want
    some of the common architecture-specific args (like arm_float_abi or
    mips_arch_variant) to be set to their defaults either if the current_cpu
    applies *or* if the v8_current_cpu applies.
   
    As described below, you can also specify the v8_target_cpu to use
    indirectly by specifying a `custom_toolchain` that contains v8_$cpu in the
    name after the normal toolchain.
   
    For example, `gn gen --args="custom_toolchain=...:clang_x64_v8_arm64"`
    is equivalent to setting --args=`v8_target_cpu="arm64"`. Setting
    `custom_toolchain` is more verbose but makes the toolchain that is
    (effectively) being used explicit.
   
    v8_target_cpu can only be used to target one architecture in a build,
    so if you wish to build multiple copies of v8 that are targeting
    different architectures, you will need to do something more
    complicated involving multiple toolchains along the lines of
    custom_toolchain, above.
